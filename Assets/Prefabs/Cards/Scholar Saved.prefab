  scenario: Thank you for saving me from that wretched place. I was studying the
    nature of the dungeon and randomness when I got ensnared by that cage. I could
    share my research with you, if you'd be willing to loan me 10 coins to build
    up a library.
  yesSuccess: Stop by sometime, I'd be more than willing to share my research with
    you... for a price
  yesFail: 
  no: This research will be forgotten if not properly utilized!
