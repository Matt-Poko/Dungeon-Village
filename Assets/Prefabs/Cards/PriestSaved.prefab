  scenario: My gods this village is riddled with evil spirits. My child, I ask that
    you confess onto me your day to day rituals no matter how evil they seem so I
    can start to clean up your land. Confession may make you feel worse right now.
    But it is good for the soul.
  yesSuccess: My child, I have decided to stick around to pray and beg for your immortal
    soul. Stop by the church at anytime for a sermon
  yesFail: 
  no: My child, confession is good for the soul. If this village is as demon filled
    as I believe I may set up a church at this location.
