  scenario: My lordship, have you noticed our recent string of misfortune? There
    are murmurs around that we are cursed. Perhaps we should sacrifice a bull to
    the gods in their honor as an offering. What say you?
  yesSuccess: Upon sacrifing the bull, it burst into flames. Leaving behind a bushel
    of apples in its place. Hopefully this is a good sign. +5 morsel +10 morality
  yesFail: Upon sacrifing the bull, it bursts into flames leaving no traces remaining.
    Hopefully this is a good sign. -5 morsel +5 morality
  no: Of course not your lordship we are not cursed. How preposterous.
